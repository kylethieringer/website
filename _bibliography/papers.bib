              Sequenced behaviours, including locomotion, reaching and vocalization, are patterned differently in
              different contexts, enabling animals to adjust to their environments. How contextual information shapes
              neural activity to flexibly alter the patterning of actions is not fully understood. Previous work has
              indicated that this could be achieved via parallel motor circuits, with differing sensitivities to context
              1,2. Here we demonstrate that a single pathway operates in two regimes dependent on recent sensory
              history. We leverage the Drosophila song production system 3 to investigate the role of several neuron
              types 4–7 in song patterning near versus far from the female fly. Male flies sing ‘simple’ trains of only
              one mode far from the female fly but complex song sequences comprising alternations between modes when
              near her. We find that ventral nerve cord (VNC) circuits are shaped by mutual inhibition and rebound
              excitability8 between nodes driving the two song modes. Brief sensory input to a direct brain-to-VNC
              excitatory pathway drives simple song far from the female, whereas prolonged input enables complex song
              production via simultaneous recruitment of functional disinhibition of VNC circuitry. Thus, female
              proximity unlocks motor circuit dynamics in the correct context. We construct a compact circuit model to
              demonstrate that the identified mechanisms suffice to replicate natural song dynamics. These results
              highlight how canonical circuit motifs 8,9 can be combined to enable circuit flexibility required for
              dynamic communication.},
